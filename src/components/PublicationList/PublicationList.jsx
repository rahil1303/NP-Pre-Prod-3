        summary: "Advances around the field of deep learning and cognitive computing have allowed mankind to look at and solve the problems of the world in a completely new way. Early detection of some deadly diseases helps save millions of lives but still, it has been observed that there seems to be no change in the way diagnosis of a particular disease takes place even in the 21st Generation of Medical Health Care. The highlight of the reasons happens to be Lack of Trust, Lack of Awareness, and Lack of Infrastructure. The health care industry seems to land blocked by their rigid methodologies and to this date, there is no involvement of the patient and caretaker staff in the digitalization of healthcare. In this project, we will introduce a digital platform for healthcare that aims to reduce the gap between a doctor, patient, and the caretaker staff. This platform is based on data, that can assist surgeons, patients, and care teams throughout the patient journey by automating some of the critical processes that are now done manually, including decision-making, post-surgery planning, tracking, and estimating recovery time, smart disease detection models, and collecting patient feedback. An important aspect of this platform will be the disease prediction models wherein we have prepared three different disease prediction models that will be able to detect if a user has that specific disease or not without the consultation of the Doctor. Here we have talked about the adoption of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in todayâ€™s Healthcare scenario and the crucial role of delivering such applications to the user on a single platform.",
